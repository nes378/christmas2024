## Dozuki
Common brand is gyokuchu
From www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/5y8r2n/differences_among_japenese_pull_saws/
95% of dozukis are cross cut, but cross cut and rip is a blurrier line in Japanese tools than in Western
There are only 3 rip dozukis commonly available:
- Gyokucho 311 Sunchild (technically hybrid but closer to rip)
- Gyokucho 303
- [Gyokucho 372](https://shop.kurashige-tools.com/en-us/products/gyokucho-razorsaw-japanese-dozuki-saw-rip-cut-240mm-372?_pos=12&_fid=c15aed986&_ss=c)
372 is common preference, random poster prefers 311
Next step up in quality would be something like [ikedame rip dozuki](https://suzukitool.com/tools/japanese-woodworking-tools/japanese-saws-nokogiri/ikeda-me/ikeda-me-dovetail-saws-ripcut-dozuki-noko-tatebiki.html) 
Best for fine work (shoji, kumiko) are [Nakaya Eaks saws](https://shop.kurashige-tools.com/en-us/products/nakaya-japanese-dozuki-saw-extra-fine-rip-cut?_pos=7&_fid=c15aed986&_ss=c)
Gyokucho generally adds a 1 to the fine saw model number: 610 is coarse, 611 is fine
Gyokucho has regular line (605/608) and extra hard for hardwoods (649/650/651)
## Chisels
From [here](https://brianholcombewoodworker.com/guide-to-japanese-chisels/) 
Oiire nomi are the common bench chisel, with a typical set ranging from 3-42mm (but can be found 1.5-48mm). Available in mentori (chamfered) profile or kaku-uchi (box) shape.
Shingo Nomi are commonly used as dovetail chisels (but intended for cutting sidewall of mortises)
Ichou-gata Nomi are fishtail chisels for half-blind dovetail cutting
Mukoumachi-Nomi are mortise chisels
Sokosarai Nomi and Kama Nomi are for cleaning up blind mortises
Our kumiko work will only use Oiire Nomi.
Basic finish type is lacquered black finish with groud ura, designed to mimic forge black finish

## Steel
Hagane: traditional Japanese high carbon steel, modern version is called Yasugi/Yasuki and is produced by Hitachi metals in the Shimane prefecture
Three main grades:
- Shirogami/White #1 & #2
	- 1 has higher carbon content than 2 (making it sharpter but more brittle), 2 is less likely to chip and is generally preferred for knives
- Aogami/Blue #1, #2
	- same carbon content as white steel, but with added tungsten and chromium
	- sharpness lasts longer, harder to sharpen than white steel
- Aogami Super
	- molybdenum and vanadium added to the same carbon
Notes from hasuseizo.com/pages/material-types
Generally prefer Hitachi White Paper 1 or Hitachi Blue 2 for chisels
# Sharpening
Keeping chisels sharp is key to success in kumiko
## Materials
### Diamond stones
[Paul Sellers](paulsellers.com/knowledge-base/sharpening) recommends these two manufacturers of diamond stones (along with other sharpening tips)
[Eze-Lap](eze-lap.com) 
[DMT](dmtsharp.com) 
### Water stones
Require soaking before use
Require occasional flattening using a flattening stone (or 120 grit sandpaper)
Prepare surface with a nagura stone
1. Flatten the face of the chisel (first time only?)
2. Grind bevel (800-1200 )
3. Refine the edge (1000-2000)
4. Polish and hone (4000-8000)
5. Deburr on leather strop
Maintain consistent angle and pressure
Possibly using a sharpening jig or guide
Avoid oil stones: their particles pack into the stones pores and clog it
Japanese stones have different grits than american stones

### Honing Guide
## Process
# Kumiko Making
## Jigs
Jigs make the manufacture of pieces quicker and more uniform. He mentions 3 jigs, two of which I don't understand at all. 
- Saw hook? Seems like it's a way to hold several strips in place to cut to rough length at once.
- Finger joint jig? Cannot discern the purpose or how to make it. He says it's a modified cross cut jig so we would probably use a different design to fit it to the track saw if it's a path we go down
- Guide blocks

### Guide Blocks
- Start with a 9x3 8/4 block of wood
- create a 1/4" deep dado 3/4" wide on the 


# Addendum
u/joelav commentary on japanese pull saws
Ryoba 240mm size is most popular
Gyokucho 610 is most popular
Gyokucho 611 is a better for large joinery
270mm Gyokucho 615 or 300mm Gyokucho 616 for generally ripping and cross cutting tasks, larger ryoba saws are very aggressive in cut
___
u/Limp-Possession chisel commentary:
if he designed a 6-chisel set
- 3mm: when you need it you need it
- 6mm: think about chisel shoulders and how to fit into corners for joinery
	- Ouchi makes a Yama ari nomi but usually uses kakuuchi nomi paring chisel for joing cleanup
- 12-15mm: do-all chisel for furniture work, balance between wide enough to eyeball flat/square and narrow enough to easily control the cut 
- 18-24mm: same as above, just bigger, start to want to have a genno to drive it
- 36-42mm: cleaning up mortise sidewalls, making wide bounary lines before chopping/sawing
	- go whole jog and get mitsu-ura (multiple back hollows, helps reference on flat suface narrower than chisel blade and ride a jig smoothly) and hiramachi (square neck profile, can press chisel flat to pare on board and bevel all the wayuntil the handle hits the board)
- 6mm mukomachinomi (or whatever size mortise you typically make)
Don't buy chisels from japan with ebony or rosewood handles as they cannot be shipped to the US

Gyokucho blades will fit any gyokucho handle, but not other brands
